# 10Day-100DaysOfPythonGPT-Calculator
Day 10 of the [100 Days of Code with Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) from Udemy.

## What is 100DaysOfPythonGPT?

100 Days of Python is a Python Bootcamp from Udemy that provides 100 days of Python pratical content with lessons and projects. The GPT part is something I'm adding to the course and infers that I shall use ChatGPT's engine and/or API in some way on each and every one of those 100 projects. Furthermore, I shall also practice using PyTest to test these projects and applications at least in some level.

## Calculator

Calculator is the tenth project of the tenth Day of the bootcamp. Its purpose is to develop the ability and habit of using return statements in functions. Besides, it uses functions as variables (something that hadn't been used before in the bootcamp).

The actual project consists of reading a number, an operator and another number and performing the asked operation with the two numbers.

It did not seam feasible to use ChatGPT's API on this project, but tests were created for each operation.

## Project Structure

 - [src/](src/) - The `calculator.py` file holds the console interface (to be used by a user) and the four functions for each available operator;
 - [test/](test/) - The `test_calculator.py` holds the test functions for each available operator function.
